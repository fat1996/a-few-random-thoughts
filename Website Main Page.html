<font size="10">Welcome to My Canvas!</font> <br>
I'm an undergrad student, studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. 
I'm learning to love programming, and to take the initiative to learn on my own.
<br>
Being in the Computer Science department of UWaterloo certainly carries a lot of weight. <br>My Canvas is a project that I've undertaken for the sole purpose of improving my proficieny in front-end languages, and eventually, back-end as well, hence the name 'My Canvas'. I realize this process will be tedious, but what better way to motivate myself than to have an ongoing project that showcases my progress upto this point.
