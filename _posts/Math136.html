Linear algebra. Need I say more? In comparison to its predecessor, I liked this course a whole lot better. Math 135 just felt like a whole bunch of different concepts that were strung together in a course. I couldn’t really connect all the different concepts that we were taught, except for maybe the stuff towards the end of the semester. In this aspect, you might like 136 a whole lot better. In terms of the difficulty, I don’t have much to say. Proofs are a real weakness of mine tbh. Granted, some of the proofs in this course were pretty computational (which proved to be really easy), but other than that, it doesn’t get easier, I can assure you. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE. Stuff will get really messy really soon, especially when you get to row reductions. Also, be prepared for quite some memorization. Similar to Math 137 last semester, you’ll be asked to memorize quite some theorems and definitions for the midterms and finals. 
Course structure: 10 assignments (worth 10%), 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Weightage of the midterm and final may vary. Best 9 assignments count towards final grade.
