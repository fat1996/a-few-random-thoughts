LOVED this course. LOVED it. Integration 101. Be prepared to integrate using a variety of techniques. PRACTICE.<br><br>
Let me explain how this course works. You start out with learning a variety of ways to integrate. That part goes by really fast. Then, they start expanding on slightly more complicated concepts. To even begin to attempt these advanced problems, you’ll need to know how to integrate. FAST. You can’t spend 20 mins trying to integrate on a question that shouldn’t have taken less than 10 mins. In summary: Just setting up a question would require you to integrate in a matter of minutes, and that won’t happen unless you’ve exposed yourself to a variety of questions. <br><br>
Tip: Remember the aforementioned ‘variety of techniques’? Sometimes, you’ll need to apply a combination of these, and things will start getting messy.
There’s something that you should remember about integration i.e. you can either make the expression a lot simpler, or make it even more hairier. It’s a matter of practice to figure out whether you’re going in the right direction or not.
