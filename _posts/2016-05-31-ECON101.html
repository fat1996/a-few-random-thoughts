Both midterms and final are MULTIPLE CHOICE. <br><br>
It's unanimously agreed upon that this is the birdiest course there is. Content wise, I hated it. Found it an absolute bore. You can probably survive the 1st 2 midterms through some intense cramming, but the final might require more work than that.  I could’ve done a lot better in this course, but when finals came rolling in, my ECON exam was 4 hours after I finished my CS exam. In retrospect, I probably should’ve looked into exam relief, but oh well.
