Well damn, this was one tough course. Personally, I don’t think its structured very well. For example, your submissions to the online quizzes get graded, but you never find out exactly which questions you answered correctly or otherwise. That’s a) frustrating and b) not helpful. The textbook questions are okay, but don’t bet on seeing similar questions on the final. I’d say take this course if you’re willing to invest a couple of hours a week on it because it <em>is</em> physics, and it requires both a theoretical understanding and mathematical computations.<br><br> You CANNOT cram for this course, I promise you. For those of you that took grade 12 physics, the 1st couple of chapters might be easy, but the content after midterms is pretty difficult to wrap your head around. As far as I remember, you do get a formula sheet, but there’s absolutely no point in having a formula sheet if you don’t know how to interpret the question. <br><br>
Tip: I’ve heard, but I’m not sure, that this course always get curved. This may actually be true considering how terribly I felt after writing the final. But don’t take my word for it.
