<td><strong>Midterms and Final</strong></td>
<td>Yes and yes. Midterm worth about 30-40%. Final worth a LOT more than it did in CS 135.</td>

			<td><strong>Professor Recommendations</strong></td>
<td>Again, Dave Tompkins. Get ready to put up a fight for spots in his section. I didn’t have him 1st semester and I realized what I had missed out on. I can honestly say I didn’t find myself dozing off during a single one of his lectures. </td>

If you already knew some programming language/s beforehand, prepare to have a blast with this course. I had programmed in Java before, so picking up C wasn’t too bad. The 1st 6-7 assignments were surprisingly easy. You’ll sail right through. Nothing too intensive. You can probably finish in 24 hours if you’re pressed for time, 2 days max. The last couple of assignments might be challenging, since that’s when we delved into the harder content. All in all, pretty riveting course.
