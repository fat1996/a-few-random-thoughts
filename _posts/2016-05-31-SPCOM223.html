Birdiest course, IMO. All it involves is having discussions, watching videos on a variety of issues, a couple of speeches, presentations etc.<br><br>
You might want to look out for professors who are known for being stingy with marks for this course. This course is an easy one to get a good mark in, and you don’t want to loose this golden opportunity.
