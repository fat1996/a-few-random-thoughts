			<td><strong>Professor Recommendations</strong></td>
<td>Janelle Resch. She's very popular for this course, which is justified, since she's brilliant. Incredibly helpful too. She'll send you extra problems every week, practice packages WITH answers before midterms and finals, and her set of online lecture notes are pretty darn good. Also, the profs might post a link to a series of lecture videos for this course on LEARN. That's a goldmine, especially for concepts that may take time to sink in. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="color: red;"><strong>Fair Warnings</strong></td>
<td>1. Finding answers to practice problems becomes a pain in university, since the profs believe that revealing the answers defeats the purpose of the practice problems. Some might reveal the answers to mock exams and midterms, others will simply refuse to. They'll gladly help you out though (which means going in during office hours).<br>
2. Similar to Math 137, you’ll be asked to memorize quite some theorems and definitions for the midterms and finals.  </td>

Linear algebra. Need I say more? In comparison to its predecessor, I liked this course a whole lot better. Math 135 just felt like a whole bunch of different concepts that were strung together in a course. I couldn’t really connect all the different concepts that we were taught, except for maybe the stuff towards the end of the semester. In this aspect, you might like 136 a whole lot better. In terms of the difficulty, I don’t have much to say. Proofs are a real weakness of mine tbh. Granted, some of the proofs in this course were pretty computational (which proved to be really easy), but other than that, it doesn’t get easier, I can assure you.<br><br> PRACTICE.<br> PRACTICE.<br> PRACTICE.<br><br> Stuff will get really messy really soon, especially when you get to row reductions. Also, be prepared for quite some memorization.
