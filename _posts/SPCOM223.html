Birdiest course, IMO. All it involves is having discussions, watching videos on a variety of issues, a couple of speeches, presentations etc.
Assignments: PLENTY. Speeches pretty much every week. Depending on how comfortable you are speaking publicly, you might have to invest some time on those speeches. 3-4 major presentations. Marks for class participation, so that’s a plus. You may need to hand in a couple of evaluations for your peers. 
Midterms and Final: None. The final presentation is worth quite a bit, but I’ll take presentations over finals any day. 
You might want to look out for professors who are known for being stingy with marks for this course. This course is an easy one to get a good mark in, and you don’t want to loose this golden opportunity.
