 This may be one of the *difficult* courses you take in 1A. To be honest, I found the 1st half of the course (before midterms) a lot more difficult than the latter half. The reasons why most struggle with this course is because it introduces math students to a completely different way of approaching the subject. Initially, it takes you a while to get used to this new paradigm of thinking, but you get used to it pretty soon. If you keep up with the assignments, by the end of the term, you'll notice a rather significant improvement within yourself.<br><br>
Keep up with assignments. Especially after midterms.<br><br>
The content after midterms becomes slightly more computation based and you will end up drowning in a huge muddle of concepts if you don't keep up with the assignments. And the worst part is, the content after midterms is all inter-connected. You forget one concept and you might as well bid adieu to the remaining ones. You can't understand the RSA scheme without linear Diophantine equations, and you can't solve linear Diophantine equations without the Euclidean algorithm. You get the gist. <br><br> 
Don't be fooled by things that you might have had seen in high school. It certainly doesn't imply that will sail through that specific chapter. The *easy* (the definition of easy becomes rather subjective at university) stuff only lasts a lecture. The rest of the chapter is building up on that *easy* content. 
Don't get complacent.
