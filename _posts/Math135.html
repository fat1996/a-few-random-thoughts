Assignments: About 10 in total. Total worth: 10%.

 This may be one of the *difficult* courses you take in 1A.To be honest, I found the 1st half of the course (before midterms) a lot more difficult than the latter half. The reasons why most struggle with this course is because it introduces math students to a completely different way of approaching the subject. Initially, it takes you a while to get used to this new paradigm of thinking, but you get used to it pretty soon. If you keep up with the assignments, by the end of the term, you'll notice a rather significant improvement within yourself. I remember studying for finals and going over the 1st few assignments. The same problems that had left me extremely confused now seemed like a piece of cake. Well, not a piece of cake. That's an overstatement. But they seemed slightly more bearable. You get the gist.
Keep up with assignments.
Especially after midterms.
The content after midterms becomes slightly more computation based. 
You will end up drowning in a huge muddle of concepts if you don't keep up with the assignments. And the worst part is, the content after midterms is all inter-connected. You forget one concept and you might as well bid adieu to the remaining ones. You can't understand the RSA scheme without linear Diophantine equations and you can't solve linear Diophantine equations without the Euclidean algorithm. 
Don't be fooled by things that you might have had seen in high school.It certainly doesn't imply that will sail through that specific chapter.The *easy* (the definition of easy becomes rather subjective at university) stuff only lasts a lecture. The rest of the chapter is building up on that *easy* content. University has a way of turning a moment of achievement into thinking "Oh hell. I actually enjoyed doing this in high school. What monstrosity is this?".
Don't get complacent.
