I loved this course, despite failing its midterm (the pass mark needed in order to progress to the next course in the math faculty is a 60. Finished the course with a 78 though :) ).<br><br>
This is your standard Calculus course, but don't be fooled.<br><br>
 This course turns out to be the underdog of 1A courses. 1st month of the semester passes and you're essentially revising all the concepts you did in high school. What a sense of joy and victory. You feel you're finally doing well in one course. Something finally makes sense. But sadly for you, the professors know that too. So they come up with a rather interesting midterm. Actually no. I'm not being completely honest. In retrospect, the midterm was actually quite fair. It was I who wasn't prepared. Which brings me to a very essential piece of advice. For those of you who'll start skipping classes (I was one of those people too, I found my calculus class a rather unappealing excuse to stay awake for 50 minutes), make sure to attend at least the last week of classes before midterms and finals. I was lucky enough to have a professor who would give out a list of questions to do from the textbook to help us prepare for the impending exam and trust me, those were invaluable. Most of the questions he would give out were pretty good reflections of what we got on the final and midterm.<br><br>
Do those questions.<br><br>
Even if you haven't attempted a single assignment question, make sure to successfully attempt and complete these questions. They've been assigned for a reason.
Generally speaking, try to stay awake during this class. It can get pretty dull. If you're anything like the rest of us, this class might be your downfall. So stay cautious.
