CS136: Might have been the 1st time I actually enjoyed a CS course. If you can, take it with Dave Tompkins. He’s phenomenal (should’ve said that in his evaluation LOL). I didn’t have him 1st semester and I realized what I had missed out on. I can honestly say I didn’t find myself dozing off during a single one of his lectures. 
If you already knew some programming language/s beforehand, prepare to have a blast with this course. I had programmed in Java before, so picking up C wasn’t too bad. The 1st 6-7 assignments were surprisingly easy. You’ll sail right through. Nothing too intensive. You can probably finish in 24 hours if you’re pressed for time, 2 days max. The last couple of assignments might be challenging, since that’s when we delved into the harder content. All in all, pretty riveting course. 
Course structure: 10-11 assignments (worth 20%), 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Weightage of the midterm and final may vary. ALL assignments count towards final grade.
