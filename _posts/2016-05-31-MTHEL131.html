This course is interesting, but be prepared to do quite a bit of memorization. Take notes. Stay awake during class. The prof’s notes are amazing, and if you listen close, you’ll be all set. You can find the notes off of oneclass pretty easily, but they might get modified a bit each year, so you might as well stick to yours. Never hurts to cross-reference though. <br><br>
WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING. MEMORIZE EVERYTHING. I remember the prof telling us a bunch of stories and dates that I thought were completely unnecessary, but they all showed up on our finals and midterms. So you need to write down everything, even stuff that you deem unnecessary. <br><br>
Tip: While its always discouraged to buy textbooks for courses, you should for this one. No one bothers to read the textbook, considering how it weighs a tonne and all, but there’s always quite a bit of content from the textbook on the midterms and finals, which 90% of the class is unprepared for. <br><br>
As far as that essay submission is concerned, it won’t take long to do it, but you may have to research the topic thoroughly. Generally, pretty easy marks. Keep in mind that when you get the initial draft back, make all the changes they specified, in your final draft. Your mark will go up drastically if you do so. The average on the initial drafts is usually pretty low (60-70’s).<br><br>
The final was a breeze. The best thing about this course is that all your answers can be written in bullet points. Infact, you’re encouraged to write in bullet points. I finished the final in under an hour and landed an 81 as my final mark. Not too bad, all things considered. <br><br>
Recommendation: Take this course. The memorization isn’t too bad. Plus, the course isn’t too demanding, and who doesn’t want that?
