Hi there! 
		Thankyou for taking out the time to read my blog.
		I started this blog for the prime purpose of dispelling some myths about 1st year CS at UWaterloo. I know I had the same questions you guys have at this point; after all, there's so much to take in! You want to prepare yourself for your courses, life at UWaterloo, know more about the coop program etc. I hope this blog can answer a few of your questions. 
This blog is an attempt to accommodate any incoming 1st years in the faculty of Math/School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Most of the experiences narrated will be faculty specific, but there's plenty of material for students from other faculties as well. 
Before you read the rest, I'd like to get some things straight. 

If you're coming to UWaterloo, prepare to be challenged.
 Going to bed after 12, compromising on sleep and meals, questioning yourself why you ever fantisized about being here, rushing to MC to submit an assignment because you totally forgot about it due to sleep deprivation etc, will become a norm.
Prepare to meet people far more talented than you.
Prepare to meet outliers.
But most importantly, become an adult. Hold yourself accountable for your mistakes and blunders, and take the initiative to improve. Make that psychological transition from being a high school student, to that of a university.
For example, assignment deadlines are concrete. And by concrete, I mean the kind when you can only be excused if you a valid documented reason. You either hand in an assignment or you don't. Which brings me to my 2nd piece of advice: 
Be proactive and well-informed of what's expected of you.
No one's going to hand you a midterm or assignment schedule. It is expected that you keep yourself within the loop. 
YOU have to check your email regularly and LEARN for updates on your courses. 
YOU have to check the university's policy on calculators, food and drink during exams, quiet hours on residence etc. 
YOU have to keep track of your fees. The university will NOT send you constant reminders regarding due fees etc. The due date will simply pass and you'll end up paying extra. Same holds true for the venues for your midterms and final exams. The exam schedule is posted along with where you'll be writing it.It is your responsibility to check where you'll be seated.
