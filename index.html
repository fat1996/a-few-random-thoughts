<div id="c13">MATH 136: Linear algebra. Need I say more? In comparison to its predecessor, I liked this course a whole lot better. Math 135 just felt like a whole bunch of different concepts that were strung together in a course. I couldn’t really connect all the different concepts that we were taught, except for maybe the stuff towards the end of the semester. In this aspect, you might like 136 a whole lot better. In terms of the difficulty, I don’t have much to say. Proofs are a real weakness of mine tbh. Granted, some of the proofs in this course were pretty computational (which proved to be really easy), but other than that, it doesn’t get easier, I can assure you. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE. Stuff will get really messy really soon, especially when you get to row reductions. Also, be prepared for quite some memorization. Similar to Math 137 last semester, you’ll be asked to memorize quite some theorems and definitions for the midterms and finals. 
Course structure: 10 assignments (worth 10%), 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Weightage of the midterm and final may vary. Best 9 assignments count towards final grade. 
</div>

<div id="c23">MATH 138: LOVED this course. LOVED it. All-things integration. Be prepared to integrate using a variety of techniques. PRACTICE.
Let me explain how this course works. You start out with learning a variety of ways to integrate. That part goes by really fast. Then, they start expanding on slightly more complicated concepts. To even begin to attempt these advanced problems, you’ll need to know how to integrate. FAST. You can’t spend 20 mins trying to integrate on a question that shouldn’t have taken more than 10 mins. In summary: Just setting up a question would require you to integrate in a matter of minutes, and that won’t happen unless you’ve exposed yourself to a variety of questions. 
Tip: Remember the aforementioned ‘variety of techniques’? Sometimes, you’ll need to apply a combination of these, and things will start getting messy.
There’s something that you should remember about integration i.e. you can either make the expression a lot simpler, or make it even more hairier. It’s a matter of practice to figure out whether you’re going in the right direction or not. 
Course structure: 10-11 assignments (worth 10%), 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Weightage of the midterm and final may vary. Best 9 assignments count towards final grade.
</div>

<div id="c33">CS136: Might have been the 1st time I actually enjoyed a CS course. If you can, take it with Dave Tompkins. He’s phenomenal (should’ve said that in his evaluation LOL). I didn’t have him 1st semester and I realized what I had missed out on. I can honestly say I didn’t find myself dozing off during a single one of his lectures. 
If you already knew some programming language/s beforehand, prepare to have a blast with this course. I had programmed in Java before, so picking up C wasn’t too bad. The 1st 6-7 assignments were surprisingly easy. You’ll sail right through. Nothing too intensive. You can probably finish in 24 hours if you’re pressed for time, 2 days max. The last couple of assignments might be challenging, since that’s when we delved into the harder content. All in all, pretty riveting course. 
Course structure: 10-11 assignments (worth 20%), 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Weightage of the midterm and final may vary. ALL assignments count towards final grade.

<li><a href="#">SPCOM 223</a></li>
<li><a href="#">PHYS 111</a></li>
<li><a href="#">MTHEL 131</a></li>
<li><a href="#">ECON 101</a></li>
</ul>

<div id="content">Electives translate into ‘courses to boost your gpa’. You need these courses to get a respectable gpa, trust me. Also, learn to study smart for these courses. You don’t want to and SHOULDN’T invest as much time on these courses as you do on your core courses. Focus on your core courses. Whether or not you get to stay in your program is largely determined by your core courses. 

<div id="c14">SPCOM 223:
Birdiest course, IMO. All it involves is having discussions, watching videos on a variety of issues, a couple of speeches, presentations etc.
Assignments: PLENTY. Speeches pretty much every week. Depending on how comfortable you are speaking publicly, you might have to invest some time on those speeches. 3-4 major presentations. Marks for class participation, so that’s a plus. You may need to hand in a couple of evaluations for your peers. 
Midterms and Final: None. The final presentation is worth quite a bit, but I’ll take presentations over finals any day. 
You might want to look out for professors who are known for being stingy with marks for this course. This course is an easy one to get a good mark in, and you don’t want to loose this golden opportunity.
</div>


<div id="c24">PHYS 111:
Assignments: Online quizzes every week. 
Attend the tutorials. You might have to do a bit of work for the tutorials, but these are just easy marks. 
Midterm and Final: Yes. Tough ones. Last couple of questions can be pretty lengthy. 

Well damn, this was one tough course. Personally, I don’t think its structured very well. For example, your submissions to the online quizzes get graded, but you never find out exactly which questions you answered correctly or otherwise. That’s a) frustrating and b) not helpful. The textbook questions are okay, but don’t bet on seeing similar questions on the final. I’d say take this course if you’re willing to invest a couple of hours a week on it because it is physics, and it requires both a theoretical understanding and mathematical computation. You CANNOT cram for this course, I promise you. For those of you that took grade 12 physics, the 1st couple of chapters might be easy, but the content after midterms is pretty difficult to wrap your head around. As far as I remember you do get a formula sheet, but there’s absolutely no point in having a formula sheet if you don’t know how to interpret the question. 
Tip: I’ve heard, but I’m not sure, that this course always get curved. This may actually be true considering how terribly I felt after writing the final. But don’t take my word for it. 
</div>


<div id="c34">MTHEL 131: 
Assignments: Nope, but there is one essay submission worth 25% of your mark. Its pretty easy, but there’s 2 drafts involved, worth 15% and 10% respectively(I think). It won’t take long to do this, but you may have to research the topic thoroughly. Generally, pretty easy marks. Keep in mind that when you get the initial draft back, make all the changes they specified in your final draft. Your mark will go up drastically if you do so. The average on the initial drafts is usually pretty low(60-70’s).
Midterm: Worth 25% when I took it.
Final: Worth 50%. The final was a breeze. The best thing about this course is that all your answers can be written in bullet points. Infact, you’re encouraged to write in bullet points. I finished the final in under an hour. Landed an 81 as my final mark. Not too bad, all things considered. 
Recommendation: Take this course. The memorization isn’t too bad. Plus, the course isn’t too demanding, and who doesn’t want that?

This course is interesting, but be prepared to do quite a bit of memorization. Take it with David Kohler if you can. He’s brilliant. I had a 3-hour lecture from 6-9pm every week, but he made it worth attending. Take it with him, and I promise you that you wont doze off. 
Take notes. Stay awake during class. The prof’s notes are amazing, and if you listen close, you’ll be all set. You can find the notes off of oneclass pretty easily, but they might get modified a bit year to year, so you might as well stick to yours. Never hurts to cross-reference though. 
MEMORIZE EVERYTHING. WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING. I remember the prof telling us a bunch of stories and dates that I thought were completely unnecessary, but they all showed up on our finals and midterms. So you need to write down everything, even stuff that you deem unnecessary. 
Tip: While its always discouraged to buy textbooks for courses, you should for this one. No one bothers to read the textbook, considering how it weighs a tonne and all, but there’s always quite a bit of content from the textbook on the midterms and finals, which 90% of the class is unprepared for. 
</div>

<div id="c44">ECON 101: 
Assignments: NONE WHATSOEVER.
Midterms: 2, each worth 25%.
Final exam: Worth 50%.
Both midterms and final are MULTIPLE CHOICE. 
Its unanimously agreed upon that this is the birdiest course there is. Content wise, I hated it. Found it an absolute bore. You can probably survive the 1st 2 midterms through some intense cramming, but the final might be brutal.  I could’ve done a lot better in this course, but when finals came rolling in, my ECON exam was 4 hours after I finished my CS exam. In retrospect, I probably should’ve looked into exam relief, but oh well.

<div id="content">

<div id="c15">How it works: 
I didn’t have any idea what the heck I was doing while choosing coop sequences before starting school. I literally only went for sequence 1 because I liked how it alternated between work and study terms. In retrospect, however, it feels like quite a sound decision. You guys might feel differently, but as my finals in 1b came rolling in, I essentially had 0 motivation to study, or even put in the effort to pass the term (I did, btw, but that’s besides the point). Add the stress of co-op into the mix, and you’ll find yourself counting down the days to the end of term. 
Co-op will be stressful. Lets just get that out of the way first. It might (and I’ve been given numerous assurances that it will) get better in your upper years, but the 1st time around, its pretty stressful. That’s because this is the first time that most of you are applying for jobs pertaining to your major. I mean, sure, we’ve all had ‘tutoring’ and ‘babysitting’ on our resumes as previous positions that we’ve held, but this time, applying to jobs will be different. Your employer will be looking at your skills with respect to the major that you are in.
As far as the process in concerned, I’ll try to explain it in as much detail as I can. 
You start off your term, and you’ll be enrolled in a PD course. That’s professional development, for short.
This PD course, is unanimously, a huge pain in the ass (no offence to CECA). 
The prime purpose of this online course is to get you newbies to make a resume, read a bunch of articles (or just skim through) about how to apply for jobs, how CECA works, how ranking works (I’ll explain all these terminologies in a while) etc. The course is quite a bore, in all honesty, but you have to pass it to get a credit. No, it doesn’t count towards your gpa. It comprises of a bunch of quizzes, and a resume submission. 

Now about that resume submission. The resume that you submit to the PD course might be quite different from the resume that you upload on job mine. That’s because the resume that your employer is interested in will be quite concise. The one that this course demands will have stuff like ‘interests and hobbies’; details that are regarded as being completely unnecessary by upper year CS students.
</div>

<div id="c25">Preparing, Fixing, Refining(and repeating..) your Resume:
As far as resumes are concerned, you could read through these suggestions. Again, these are just suggestions, not guarantees.

Visually:
1.	If you have the time, which you will, once you’re done 1a, try writing your resume in latex. For those of you that don’t know (I was in the same boat), latex is a document markup language. If you’re unsure, view a sample document written in latex. Having your resume in Latex gives both you, as the prospective job applicant, and your resume, a good impression. I don’t think you can become proficient in Latex in the 2 weeks or so that you’ll have (people spend entire semesters writing their assignments in latex to reach that level of proficiency), but you can certainly learn as much to complete your resume. 
Tip:  There’s tonnes of help available online. You can just about google everything.  A couple of tutorials on YouTube, a few google searches, and I promise you you’ll be able to complete your resume, no problem.
2.	While creating your resume, take a look at some resumes of upper year students and model yours accordingly. You don’t want to go too overboard, and at the same time, you don’t want it to look too dull. It needs to look visually appealing and balanced. Moderation is key. 

Content-wise:
1.	Please don’t put your accomplishments from middle school. Your resume should only have your accomplishments from the past 3-4 years (some may even suggest a smaller time frame). Again, you need to give your accomplishments some thought. Which ones are really worth it? Keep in mind that you’re competing with a large audience. You need to advertise yourself. The employer’s not going to have a premonition that you’re a worthy candidate. 
2.	DO NOT HAVE A TWO PAGE RESUME. THAT’S A BIG NO. HIGHLY FROWNED UPON. The employer doesn’t care how many accomplishments you have; they’re interested in the big ones. They’ll skim your resume, quite literally. You don’t want to bore them. Keep it short and only put on stuff that’ll establish you as a strong candidate.
3.	Make sure to include brief descriptions of your accomplishments. Just putting on ‘volunteer at XYZ’ isn’t sufficient and doesn’t convey anything to the employer. Include key details, and what you took away from this experience. This was something that most people asked me to revise on my resume. Again, don’t go overboard with the descriptions. You shouldn’t have an essay narrating your experience. 
4.	USE BULLET POINTS. 
5.	Use figures/numbers if you have them to convey meaningful details. 
6.	I have to give credit where its due. The PD course will give you access to a list of ‘resume action verbs’ that are essential for resumes. Words like ‘developed’, ‘engaged’, ‘assisted’ etc. Use these words. They convey your takeaway from your experiences quite efficiently.
7.	Use headings. 

Refining: 
1.	Once you’re finished with your resume, you HAVE to get it checked by upper year students, irrespective of how conscious you feel about it. You JUST HAVE TO. Its crucial. You could get some of your friends to look at it, but I don’t really see the point in that, considering they’re new to this as well. 
2.	Don’t go overboard with the above stated suggestion. Loads of people tend to do that, and I’ve been advised that it does more harm than good, since you get loads of opinions, most of which are contradicting. Keep it to 3-4 people (that what I did, and it worked out pretty well) and do incorporate the changes they suggest. They’re upper years’ students, who’ve been through these experiences. You might not agree with their suggestions, but you have do it. They have a much better sense of what the employer wants from your resume.
3.	If you want to be proactive (which you should, considering how you’ll be swamped with your courses by the time job mine opens), you should try to have your resume completed before the semester starts. You might find it quite stressful to balance both your courses and your resume. 

</div>


<div id="c35">Interview: 
JOBMINE:
Jobmine is the University of Waterloo’s ‘portal’ (for lack of a better word) for co-op. Basically, you’re granted access to it roughly 2 weeks after the semester begins. You’ll use it to search for jobs, upload your resume (your transcript will already be there) etc. Your interviews will be scheduled through job mine, as well as whether you got the job or not(rankings). 

How it works:
Okay, so you’re almost 2-3 weeks into your semester. You have been granted access to job mine. You will start by uploading your resume. Your resume and transcript is the official package that gets submitted to a possible employer every time you apply for a job. Once this is done, go through the job listings. READ through the job descriptions carefully. Apply. Wait. Mentally brace yourselves for the rejections (which, as you’ll eventually come to realise, are inevitable). Be proud of being selected for interviews. Repeat.
That’s it. Literally. That’s the whole hype behind job mine.

A few casual reminders though:
1.	During the 1st and 2nd round (I think), you’re limited to 50 applications. USE THESE APPLICATIONS. They’ve been allotted to you for a reason. But use them well. Don’t just apply for every job. You have to do some rough approximations. Try to calculate the likability of being chosen for the job (more on that later) and your level of interest in the job. Lots of people complain of having being chosen for a job that they’re not really interested in. Be smart about it. 
2.	I asked quite a few seniors on how on when to apply for the job. Let me clarify. You view a job description, and you feel like you meet some of the requirements. Most upper years are of the opinion that if you feel you satisfy about 50% or greater of the job requirements, you should go ahead and apply. That’s a pretty safe bet.
3.	Some jobs might require a cover letter (what a pain). Banks have a real special corner for cover letters. Its always nice to have a sample one saved. This way if you’re asked to include one, you make a few changes, change a few company names and you’re good.

A final note: Aim to have these ‘prerequisites’ ready before job mine opens. Trust me when I say its going to get crazy when it does open. Just going through the list of jobs is going to take quite a while. And the 1st round doesn’t go on forever, just for about 2-3 days. So you’ll be rushing against time, applying for the best jobs, and trying to balance school work. Midterms will be just around the corner.

What happens next?
Okay, so that’s the process of applying for the jobs. We have that down. Now comes the fancy part of giving the interview, waiting for the employer to ‘rank’ you, and waiting for the ‘matching’ to take place.

Here’s a definition of all these terms:
You will be scheduled for an interview along with a few other candidates. Either you get an email informing you of your interview selection, or you’ll have to check jobmine yourself. DO check jobmine for interviews. I’ve been told that sometimes CECA forgets to send an email.
Next, you’ll will have to select a time slot. Easy enough. Most interviews take place at CECA (Centre for Career Action). Your interview can either be in person and via skype. I have experience with both types, and in IMO, in person ones are way better. But that varies for person to person. My worst interview was via skype and one of my friends bagged a job through an interview via skype. Case in point. 

DON’T MISS AN INTERVIEW. THAT’S A BIG NO. That’s because 1) You’ll make CECA really mad and 2) Leaves a really bad impression of you on the employer.  Even if you hate the job, you HAVE to attend the interview. If you have issues with interview scheduling or something along those lines, contact CECA asap. Not only because they’ll be able to help you, but largely because you don’t want to get on their dark side. They might make you write an apology letter (who wants to do that?), and you might even get kicked out of Job mine, and that’s not advisable unless you have jobs lined for you outside of job mine. 

I’m aware of the whole debate that goes around regarding the usefulness of job mine and CECA. True, applying for jobs through this route can be painstaking sometimes. You have to pass the PD courses, as well as write out work term reports and whatnot. You’ll probably meet numerous people who’ll have jobs lined up for them outside of jobmine. Good for them. Here’s what I think: If you’re in co-op, you might as well avail this opportunity. You might choose to opt out of it once you’ve established yourself a bit in the industry, but I’d advise you not to take any chances during 1st year. Plus, this way the process is pretty streamlined, so you’ll be avoiding quite a bit of unnecessary headache.

Rankings:
Once the interview is conducted, the employer submits his rankings. Rankings are basically a number from 1-9, with 1 implying that the job is yours, provided that you accept the offer, and 9 being the lowest. Being ranked means you’re still in the race. Not being ranked implies a dead end. No, you won’t know what number you got ranked. 
Once rankings open, you’ll either see ‘Offer’, ‘Ranked’, or ‘Not Ranked’ (not sure about the last one). Yes, there is a job mine glitch that helps you figure out beforehand if you got ranked or not, but you can search it up online. 
 Don’t lose hope if you didn’t get ranked 1.
When the employer submits the rankings is entirely up to them. Some do them instantly after the interview has been conducted, others the day rankings open, but that shouldn’t bother you. There’s not much you can do once you’ve given the interview other than pray. Here’s an explanation of how rankings work: Your employer ranks you first, followed by you ranking them. When rankings open, you view what your employer ranked you, submit your rankings of the employer, and then matching begins. 
You can find the day rankings open on the CECA website. If you see ‘Offer’, congratulations, you got the job. 
If its says ‘Ranked’, you can go 1 of 2 ways: 1. The recommended way:  Take the job, even if you don’t want it. I personally know people who didn’t want the jobs they got offers for, but refusal to accept this offer may result in a lot of unnecessary trouble, like getting kicked out of CECA. Not worth it. 2. Not take it, duh, and land in the above stated trouble.


Matching and what follows after:
I won’t go into the details of the algorithm behind matching (you can find those details on the CECA website), but I can explain possible scenarios. With matching, nothing’s certain. Say you got an offer from your employer, but you don’t want the job. In this case, your best shot is to rank them a 9. But even ranking them a 9 doesn’t guarantee that you won’t get this job. You still might get it (happened to one of my friends). Similarly, you could only get ranked, rank your employer ‘1’ in return, and get the job (which is what happened in my case). My point being, matching is quite a game of chance. 
Once you’ve been matched with a job, according to CECA guidelines, you have to email your employer and set up your work related details. Its pretty smooth sailing from this point onwards. Some organizations may require you to get police reference checks etc, but the hard part’s over. You can now sit back, relax, and focus on the remaining semester. 
You might hear people saying how the good job offers get snagged during the 1st round, leaving the ‘crappy’ jobs for the people in the continuous rounds. I’m not sure how true that is. But there’s definitely nothing wrong with having to continue all the way to continuous round. You have to be patient. Trust me. A lot of patience. You’ll here nightmares of people having to wait all the way until finals to finally get a job offer. Those aren’t just tales. They actually happen. So you need to persevere. 

Interviews:
A few pointers for interviews:
1.	Dress up. I can’t reiterate the importance of leaving a good impression.
2.	Research the company. You should have some talking points in mind.  
Interviews are intimidating. You know you’re being judged by a prospective employer, and that’s enough to make anyone conscious of themselves. 
Everyone interviews differently. For some people, giving the interview is the easiest part, since they advertise themselves well through in-person interaction. For others, this is the worst part. Their resume speaks volumes but they fail miserably during the interview. Again, these are experiences. If they go badly, learn something from them and vow to improve the next time. My 1st interview was in person and the 2nd one was via skype. The 1st one went beautifully, but I totally wrecked my chances during the 2nd one. Don’t beat yourself over it. If you feel you lack in this area, attend the mock interviews held at CECA, or at some time by the math faculty. 

</div>



<div id="c45">Last minute hacks:
TBH, everything I’ve listed so far is pretty much a last minute hack. And by last minute, I mean a couple of weeks. I worked on all this stuff during my Christmas break, so I’d say everything I just listed in pretty do-able in 2-3 weeks. 
If you’re like me and you have no prior coding experience, or little to none, it might help to pick up a few languages (I’d say aim for quality over quantity) over your break once the semester ends. Mind you, you should aim to have a project in these languages by the time you start applying to jobs, so don’t be too overly-ambitious. No one expects you to have the next social networking website up and running for your 1st co-op, but you should have something to show and talk about. You’re going to be asked to describe your projects during interviews, and you should have a clear sense of your end goal, and your progress so far. 
If you have absolutely no clue where to start from, as a tried and tested suggestion, you could start off with HTML/CSS. They’re pretty straightforward to learn and your project could be creating your own website. Easiest trick in the book, and literally every CS student has designed their own website. You could add elements and functionality to it later (through JavaScript, bootstrap), but for the time being, stick to HTML and CSS, and you can create a reasonably good looking website. Link to your blog (if you have one), contact information and your resume, to name a few. Its the perfect way to showcase your progress, and you could always make improvements as you learn more frontend languages. You can find amazing online courses on front end development on Udacity, Coursera, Udemy etc. The reason I’d say HTML and CSS is a good point to start at is because a) they’re honestly quite easy. I’m not implying in any way that they don’t require any effort, but once you have a basic sense of how the major elements work, you can navigate around, no problem. The one thing I would very strongly recommend is to have a very solid sense of what you want your website to look like, and not to get sidetracked. Learning about the different CSS styles can quite literally go on forever, so if you don’t want to be overwhelmed, have a clear sense of what you want your end product to look like. 
Tip: YouTube will never fail you.  
Stay on track. Its very easy to gravitate towards other projects, but you have to remind yourself that you’re on a deadline. You need to have something to showcase by crunch time.
