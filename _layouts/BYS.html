<div id="Section1">1st Year Course Selection
Course selection is straightforward. It seemed like a rather daunting task before the semester began, but if you thoroughly read through the website of the David Cheriton School of Computer Science (the FAQ section, a link is provided in <a href="#Section6">Other useful resources for Incoming 1st years</a>), you'll know what to do. Again, be sure to check your email address regularly. 
<br>
In CS, you're pre-enrolled in 3 of your 5 courses. These include MATH 135, MATH 137 and CS135.
<br>
Here's a brief description of these 3 courses:

<!MATH 135>
<div id="math135">MATH 135:
 This may be one of the *difficult* courses you take in 1A.To be honest, I found the 1st half of the course (before midterms) a lot more difficult than the latter half. The reasons why most struggle with this course is because it introduces math students to a completely different way of approaching the subject. Initially, it takes you a while to get used to this new paradigm of thinking, but you get used to it pretty soon. If you keep up with the assignments, by the end of the term, you'll notice a rather significant improvement within yourself. I remember studying for finals and going over the 1st few assignments. The same problems that had left me extremely confused now seemed like a piece of cake. Well, not a piece of cake. That's an overstatement. But they seemed slightly more bearable. You get the gist.
Keep up with assignments.
Especially after midterms.
The content after midterms becomes slightly more computation based. 
You will end up drowning in a huge muddle of concepts if you don't keep up with the assignments. And the worst part is, the content after midterms is all inter-connected. You forget one concept and you might as well bid adieu to the remaining ones. You can't understand the RSA scheme without linear Diophantine equations and you can't solve linear Diophantine equations without the Euclidean algorithm. 
Don't be fooled by things that you might have had seen in high school.It certainly doesn't imply that will sail through that specific chapter.The *easy* (the definition of easy becomes rather subjective at university) stuff only lasts a lecture. The rest of the chapter is building up on that *easy* content. University has a way of turning a moment of achievement into thinking "Oh hell. I actually enjoyed doing this in high school. What monstrosity is this?".
Don't get complacent.</div>

<!MATH 137>

<div id="math137">MATH 137:
 I loved this course, despite failing its midterm (the pass mark needed in order to progress to the next course in the math faculty is a 60).This is your standard Calculus course. 
 But don't be fooled.
 This course turns out to be the underdog of 1A courses.1st month of the semester passes and you're essentially revising all the concepts you did in high school. What a sense of joy and victory. You feel you're finally doing well in one course. Something finally makes sense. You know that. But sadly for you, the professors know that too. So they come up with a rather interesting midterm. No wait. I'm not being completely honest. In retrospect, the midterm was actually quite fair. It was I who wasn't prepared. Which brings me to a very essential piece of advice. For those of you who'll start skipping classes (I was one of those people too, I found my calculus class a rather unattractive excuse to stay awake for 50 minutes), make sure to attend at least the last week of classes before midterms and finals. I was lucky enough to have a professor (god bless his soul) who would give out a list of questions to do from the textbook to help us prepare for the impending exam and trust me, those were invaluable .Most of the questions he would give out were pretty good reflections of what we got on the final and midterm.
Do those questions.
Even if you haven't attempted a single assignment question, make sure to successfully attempt and complete these questions. They've been assigned for a reason.
Generally speaking, try to stay awake during this class. It can get pretty dull. If you're anything like the rest of us, this class might be your downfall. So stay cautious.</div>

<!CS 135>
<div id="cs135">CS135: 
Okay, so even though I didn't score as well as I'd hoped in this class, I actually found it to be pretty interesting. Tbh,if I were to rate all my 1A courses in terms of how interesting they were, this would top the list. Firstly, because it introduces you to a different (slightly mysterious) programming language. And secondly, well because, I just liked the assignments quite a bit. They were challenging, absolutely, but fun nevertheless. And the most important reason of all, it forces you to become well acquainted with one of the most dreaded concepts in 1st year, recursion. You will live and breathe recursion. 
People often ask how to prepare themselves for this course and in my opinion, you don't really need to prepare for it in any way. They give you a pretty solid introduction. Initially, it might be a bit of a struggle, but nothing too unsurmountable. And I'd also heard of how it's difficult to wrap your head around DrRacket if you've already been working with imperative languages(Java,C++ etc),but I didn't find that to be true, despite the fact that I'd been working in Java for quite a while. But that might differ. Overall, a pretty enjoyable course. 
Fair warning: Keep up with the assignments. You may be able to survive without doing the assignments in your other courses, but survival in CS135 will be next to impossible without completing the assignments. Plus, if you manage to complete all 10, that's roughly 20% of your grade guaranteed.</div>

<!ADDITIONAL COMMENTS>
<div id="helpful-hacks">Additional Comments:
I ended 1A with a 75% average. Definitely not what I aimed for, but not too bad either. But aside from academics, I think my biggest achievement this semester was discovering how to take advantage of the way the semester works. If you keep in mind your course outlines, 10-20% of your grade is guaranteed through assignments. The remaining is distributed between midterms and finals. Learn to take advantage of this fact. Don't be one of those people who think they'll do superb on the midterms and finals and can just casually avoid doing assignments. Assignments are there for a reason.
a) They help you stay updated on whatever's happening in class. Even if you're the kind that's sleeping in class, the assignment will force you to go over the concepts covered in the past week.
b) They force you to confront your fears early on in the semester rather than the night before finals. I made it a point to complete my assignments for each course, irrespective of whether I was attending class or not. This way, the week before finals, I was quite comfortable with the course material. Usually, the questions on the assignments are considered a tad more difficult than those you might see on the finals or midterm. This proves to be excellent practice. 
Trust me when I say this, course work in university piles on without you even noticing, so learn to take advantage of the semester. It comes in handy. Try to score as high as possible on the midterms. I'm certainly not implying that you shouldn't ace your finals, but I found that if you get a reasonably high enough grade on your midterms, finals don't pose as much of a threat. My point being, the higher your mark is going into the finals, the lesser there's a chance that you might fail the course. 
Finals and midterms in university do not resemble high school exams at all. They test you on the material you've covered, yes, but there's a lot of more application involved. So don't pin all your hopes to the finals. Grab all possible opportunities to raise your mark while you can. And that includes i-clicker marks too (participation marks, roughly 5% in CS135).</div>


<!CHOOSING A SEQUENCE>
<div id="choosing-seq">Choosing your Co-op sequence:
Choosing a sequence depends entirely on you. When I was applying, sequence 1 was the most popular (always has been, I think).I decided to opt for sequence 2.This meant that my first co-op term was going to be after 1B (so spring 2016).However, I did know a lot of people who went for sequence 3 or 4, because they wanted the summer after 1B off, or simply wanted more experience/study terms before they started applying for jobs. No judgement there, that's totally up to you. In my case, I was really eager to find out how I would fare in the 'real' world, so I opted for sequence 2. Plus, it also gave me the motivation to start working on some side projects. In all its entirety, opt for the sequence that you feel comfortable in. Switching a sequence is possible, but it might be difficult once you've chosen one, since you have to find someone who wants to switch into your sequence.
