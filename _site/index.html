<div class="container">     <strong>Hi there!</strong> <br>
		Thankyou for taking out the time to read my blog.
		<br><br>I started this blog for the purpose of dispelling some myths about 1st year CS at UWaterloo. I know I had the same questions you guys have at this point; after all, there's so much to take in! You want to prepare yourself for future courses, life at UWaterloo, the co-op program etc. I hope this blog can answer a few of your questions. <br><br>

Before you read the rest, I'd like to get some things straight. <br>
Surviving 1st year at UWaterloo won't be an easy task. 
<br>It will break you, catch you off guard, make you question yourself and the choices that you've made so far.
<br>It'll challenge you, and force you to stretch yourself to the point of breaking. But it'll also give you the strength and support that you need to build yourself back up again. If you're ambitious and committed to succeeding, the conducive ecosystem at UWaterloo will be your biggest ally.<br><br>
I just finished 1st year a couple of months ago. Take it from someone who recently experienced a myriad of emotions in an effort to make it to the finish line; you're going to need to persevere. 
<br>Your 1A average may be dissappointing. You may not get your 1st co-op job, you may fail midterms, and you may feel incredibly drained. You're going to make those 12am calls to your parents, crying over how terribly you're doing at school, and that nothing seems to be working out. I did literally EVERYTHING listed above. So did a majority of my class. While I wouldn't wish that on anyone, if it does happen to you, I'm here to tell you that's it's okay. <strong>That's normal.</strong> I know that right now you're all fresh out of high school. You've all been top 5% of your graduating class. You're getting acceptances from all the top schools, and scholarship offers tagging along. You feel on top of the world, and you will continue to do so until O-week. I did too. Hell, I remember shaking my head in disagreement as people told me the exact same things that I'm listing right now. <br><br>
'15-20% drop in average? Ridiculous. I was top of my class. That obviously isn't going to happen to me.'<br>
'Failing a midterm? Pshh. What nonsense. I don't fail midterms.'<br>
These were my exact thoughts as upper year CS students narrated us their experiences during O-week. And guess what? They were right. I did fail a midterm. My average did drop. At that point, I thought it was the end of the world. I mean, I had South Asian parents, they were gonna grill me over what on earth was happening with my grades. Scared of succumbing to the horrifying tales of depression, I reached out to an upper year CS student, and asked her for advice. That might have been the smartest thing I could've done in 1st year. This was towards the end of 1A. By the time 1st year came to an end, my grades were improving, I had managed to secure a co-op job, and I found myself tonnes more happier than I ever have been during the past 18 years. <strong>And so will you.</strong> I promise you that. 

<br><br>By the time 1st year ends, you will notice changes within yourself. You will feel a lot more prouder of the little accomplishments that you took for granted before, and you'll learn to hold yourself accountable for your mistakes and blunders, and take the initiative to improve. 
<br><br>
But you've made it to UWaterloo, and that's not something trivial. It may sound horrifying right now, but I promise you that your 1st year will be worth all the struggle :)
