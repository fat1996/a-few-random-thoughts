<p>Welcome page. add info here
OMG I just finished 1B.
And I feel like  MILLION BUCKS.
So much wisdom to give out, young froshies.
August of last year, I remember myself messaging upper year students at the CS faculty at UWaterloo, and asking them the same questions that you guys are asking right now. I wanted to know if I could keep up the same average as I had in high school, how difficult the courses were, and was really desperate to know what this ‘proof-based’ math was like(since that confuses a lot of people). I got a wide range of answers, and as I began 1A, I quickly realized a couple of things. Here are some popular myths about 1st year in CS/Math that I’m going to try to dispel, as objectively as I can:
I’ll keep adding more stuff.
FAQ’S:
1.	What on earth will happen to my average?
2.	What’s this ‘proof’ based math?
3.	I have no prior programming experience. Will I make it?
4.	Is CS at UWaterloo worth it?
ABSOLUTELY. You’ll find yourself reduced to tears with failed midterms, the sheer brutality of the coursework, and the stress. But at the end of every semester, regardless of how you performed academically, you’ll realise that you grew in some way another. Whether its an academic improvement, or social, or spiritual(you’ll feel a lot closer to god after surviving a semester here, trust me) etc, you will be proud of what you’ve accomplished. And you know what? You should. You should feel proud of surviving here. Even if you just passed on the verge of a 60, vow to improve the next time, and don’t mope around. Absolutely no mopping around. You’ve survived when loads of people couldn’t. 











All things coop.
Here goes.
Okay, so I’m in stream 1, which meant that my 1st 2 terms were going to be study terms, followed by a work term. So by the time 1B rolled in, I was terrified of my co-op prospects. 
‘OHMYGOD, my resume’s essentially half a page. Hmmm. I wonder if increasing the font size will do the trick.’
‘Dear Lord, I’m not even asking for a positive bank balance. Please just let me break even.’
And a worse case scenario (which mind you, goes through the mind oe very student during their undergrad), ‘I’m dropping out.’
80% WILL have these thoughts as you approach your co-op term. You’ll stress about your resume, and reviewing other people’s projects on their github will become a past time as you look for ideas. Prepare for feel even worse once interview offers start rolling in, and eventually job offers. I’m here to give you a pat on the back and to hopefully, make you feel a bit better about yourself. Been there, done that.
I’m gonna be honest with you. I wasn’t the smartest, brightest or the most qualified of the lot in my program. Neither were my closest friends, But we managed to score jobs, and atm, we’re enjoying them quite a bit. 















Last Minute Hacks:
TBH, everything I’ve listed so far is pretty much a last minute hack. And by last minute, I mean a couple of weeks. I worked on all this stuff during my Christmas break, so I’d say everything I just listed in pretty do-able in 2-3 weeks. 
If you’re like me and you have no prior coding experience, or little to none, it might help to pick up a few languages (I’d say aim for quality over quantity) over your break once the semester ends. Mind you, you should aim to have a project in these languages by the time you start applying to jobs, so don’t be too overly-ambitious. No one expects you to have the next social networking website up and running for your 1st co-op, but you should have something to show and talk about. You’re going to be asked to describe your projects during interviews, and you should have a clear sense of your end goal, and your progress so far. 
If you have absolutely no clue where to start from, as a tried and tested suggestion, you could start off with HTML/CSS. They’re pretty straightforward to learn and your project could be creating your own website. Easiest trick in the book, and literally every CS student has designed their own website. You could add elements and functionality to it later (through JavaScript, bootstrap), but for the time being, stick to HTML and CSS, and you can create a reasonably good looking website. Link to your blog (if you have one), contact information and your resume, to name a few. Its the perfect way to showcase your progress, and you could always make improvements as you learn more frontend languages. You can find amazing online courses on front end development on Udacity, Coursera, Udemy etc. The reason I’d say HTML and CSS is a good point to start at is because a) they’re honestly quite easy. I’m not implying in any way that they don’t require any effort, but once you have a basic sense of how the major elements work, you can navigate around, no problem. The one thing I would very strongly recommend is to have a very solid sense of what you want your website to look like, and not to get sidetracked. Learning about the different CSS styles can quite literally go on forever, so if you don’t want to be overwhelmed, have a clear sense of what you want your end product to look like. 
Tip: YouTube will never fail you.  
Stay on track. Its very easy to gravitate towards other projects, but you have to remind yourself that you’re on a deadline. You need to have something to showcase by crunch time. 








On a side note:
You’ll hear plenty of people complaining about the job offers they have, or are being forced to accept. IMO, I find that very annoying. Now it would make sense if someone with over 2-3 years of experience was complaining about being forced to accept a job that only pays minimum wage. That’s a perfectly acceptable reason to challenge such a compulsion. But if it’s a 1st year with a sense of entitlement, I don’t agree. You need to have a larger perspective of things.
You maybe in the coop program at UWaterloo, part of a faculty that is immensely coveted throughout the country. But that in no way gurantees that you’ll find employment, and neither should you have that kind of a mindset. You need to realize that you still have to make a huge amount of effort to get the kind of job
