<div id="textbox">     The 'I don't have an acceptance yet' Syndrome
			If you're reading this and find yourself agreeing with the title, first of all, I'd like to give you a pat on the back. 
We've all been here.
Right now, your friends are probably getting acceptances from similar programs, being offered scholarships and what not, while you sink deeper and deeper into a pit of sadness. Here's an account of my grade 12 year, the few painful months before the 1st June deadline:
I immigrated to Canada in 2013, did grade 11 from the East Coast, senior year from Ontario. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting what we call an 'early acceptance'. I was okay with that. I had mentally prepared myself for a lengthy period of wait. There were a bunch of people in my class who, rumor has it, received acceptances almost 2-3 weeks after applying. I'm not sure exactly how valid these rumors were, but true or not, they made me feel even worse about myself. What was wrong with me? Was I not good enough? I was a 95+ average student, just like Waterloo was rumored to accept. Why was I not being accepted then?
It's perfectly normal to be concerned about whether you're going to be accepted into your dream university. But please, refrain from the following two things:
1. Posting your list of credentials, accomplishments and average on discussion forums and asking people whether you'll get in or not. This is not helpful at all.
 People on the discussion forum are NOT on Waterloo's admission committee. Even if they were, they can't guarantee you an acceptance.
2. We've all experienced people who straight out post the dreaded 'no, you don't have a chance'. First and foremost, ignore such people. Secondly, hearing such negativity will only make you feel worse.

You should be confident in your abilities when you're applying. Have some faith in yourself. Don't pay any heed to what people tell you online, regardless of whether they're assuring you that you'll be accepted or if they're flat out telling you that you'll be rejected.
My advice during this painful wait is to focus on finishing your last semester. I know it becomes incredibly painful by the end, but keep in mind that acceptances are always conditional. All your acceptance packages come with a fair warning of your acceptance being withdrawn if you fail to keep up with the University's standards.
