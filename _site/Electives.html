<div id="content">Electives translate into ‘courses to boost your gpa’. You need these courses to get a respectable gpa, trust me. Also, learn to study smart for these courses. You don’t want to and SHOULDN’T invest as much time on these courses as you do on your core courses. Focus on your core courses. Whether or not you get to stay in your program is largely determined by your core courses. 

<div id="spcom223">SPCOM 223:
Birdiest course, IMO. All it involves is having discussions, watching videos on a variety of issues, a couple of speeches, presentations etc.
Assignments: PLENTY. Speeches pretty much every week. Depending on how comfortable you are speaking publicly, you might have to invest some time on those speeches. 3-4 major presentations. Marks for class participation, so that’s a plus. You may need to hand in a couple of evaluations for your peers. 
Midterms and Final: None. The final presentation is worth quite a bit, but I’ll take presentations over finals any day. 
You might want to look out for professors who are known for being stingy with marks for this course. This course is an easy one to get a good mark in, and you don’t want to loose this golden opportunity.
</div>


<div id="phys111">PHYS 111:
Assignments: Online quizzes every week. 
Attend the tutorials. You might have to do a bit of work for the tutorials, but these are just easy marks. 
Midterm and Final: Yes. Tough ones. Last couple of questions can be pretty lengthy. 

Well damn, this was one tough course. Personally, I don’t think its structured very well. For example, your submissions to the online quizzes get graded, but you never find out exactly which questions you answered correctly or otherwise. That’s a) frustrating and b) not helpful. The textbook questions are okay, but don’t bet on seeing similar questions on the final. I’d say take this course if you’re willing to invest a couple of hours a week on it because it is physics, and it requires both a theoretical understanding and mathematical computation. You CANNOT cram for this course, I promise you. For those of you that took grade 12 physics, the 1st couple of chapters might be easy, but the content after midterms is pretty difficult to wrap your head around. As far as I remember you do get a formula sheet, but there’s absolutely no point in having a formula sheet if you don’t know how to interpret the question. 
Tip: I’ve heard, but I’m not sure, that this course always get curved. This may actually be true considering how terribly I felt after writing the final. But don’t take my word for it.

<div id="mthel131">MTHEL 131: 
Assignments: Nope, but there is one essay submission worth 25% of your mark. Its pretty easy, but there’s 2 drafts involved, worth 15% and 10% respectively(I think). It won’t take long to do this, but you may have to research the topic thoroughly. Generally, pretty easy marks. Keep in mind that when you get the initial draft back, make all the changes they specified in your final draft. Your mark will go up drastically if you do so. The average on the initial drafts is usually pretty low(60-70’s).
Midterm: Worth 25% when I took it.
Final: Worth 50%. The final was a breeze. The best thing about this course is that all your answers can be written in bullet points. Infact, you’re encouraged to write in bullet points. I finished the final in under an hour. Landed an 81 as my final mark. Not too bad, all things considered. 
Recommendation: Take this course. The memorization isn’t too bad. Plus, the course isn’t too demanding, and who doesn’t want that?

This course is interesting, but be prepared to do quite a bit of memorization. Take it with David Kohler if you can. He’s brilliant. I had a 3-hour lecture from 6-9pm every week, but he made it worth attending. Take it with him, and I promise you that you wont doze off. 
Take notes. Stay awake during class. The prof’s notes are amazing, and if you listen close, you’ll be all set. You can find the notes off of oneclass pretty easily, but they might get modified a bit year to year, so you might as well stick to yours. Never hurts to cross-reference though. 
MEMORIZE EVERYTHING. WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING. I remember the prof telling us a bunch of stories and dates that I thought were completely unnecessary, but they all showed up on our finals and midterms. So you need to write down everything, even stuff that you deem unnecessary. 
Tip: While its always discouraged to buy textbooks for courses, you should for this one. No one bothers to read the textbook, considering how it weighs a tonne and all, but there’s always quite a bit of content from the textbook on the midterms and finals, which 90% of the class is unprepared for. 
</div>

<div id="econ101">ECON 101: 
Assignments: NONE WHATSOEVER.
Midterms: 2, each worth 25%.
Final exam: Worth 50%.
Both midterms and final are MULTIPLE CHOICE. 
Its unanimously agreed upon that this is the birdiest course there is. Content wise, I hated it. Found it an absolute bore. You can probably survive the 1st 2 midterms through some intense cramming, but the final might be brutal.  I could’ve done a lot better in this course, but when finals came rolling in, my ECON exam was 4 hours after I finished my CS exam. In retrospect, I probably should’ve looked into exam relief, but oh well.
