<div id="content">You’ll thank me for this later: Some courses may require online assignment submissions. Download the app ‘camscanner’ on your cellphone. It allows you to scan and upload documents through your phone. You’ll save yourselves a lot of trips to the library. I’ve submitted assignments at 4 in the morning, courtesy of this app.

<div id="math136">MATH 136: Linear algebra. Need I say more? In comparison to its predecessor, I liked this course a whole lot better. Math 135 just felt like a whole bunch of different concepts that were strung together in a course. I couldn’t really connect all the different concepts that we were taught, except for maybe the stuff towards the end of the semester. In this aspect, you might like 136 a whole lot better. In terms of the difficulty, I don’t have much to say. Proofs are a real weakness of mine tbh. Granted, some of the proofs in this course were pretty computational (which proved to be really easy), but other than that, it doesn’t get easier, I can assure you. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE. Stuff will get really messy really soon, especially when you get to row reductions. Also, be prepared for quite some memorization. Similar to Math 137 last semester, you’ll be asked to memorize quite some theorems and definitions for the midterms and finals. 
Course structure: 10 assignments (worth 10%), 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Weightage of the midterm and final may vary. Best 9 assignments count towards final grade.

<div id="math138">MATH 138: LOVED this course. LOVED it. All-things integration. Be prepared to integrate using a variety of techniques. PRACTICE.
Let me explain how this course works. You start out with learning a variety of ways to integrate. That part goes by really fast. Then, they start expanding on slightly more complicated concepts. To even begin to attempt these advanced problems, you’ll need to know how to integrate. FAST. You can’t spend 20 mins trying to integrate on a question that shouldn’t have taken more than 10 mins. In summary: Just setting up a question would require you to integrate in a matter of minutes, and that won’t happen unless you’ve exposed yourself to a variety of questions. 
Tip: Remember the aforementioned ‘variety of techniques’? Sometimes, you’ll need to apply a combination of these, and things will start getting messy.
There’s something that you should remember about integration i.e. you can either make the expression a lot simpler, or make it even more hairier. It’s a matter of practice to figure out whether you’re going in the right direction or not. 
Course structure: 10-11 assignments (worth 10%), 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Weightage of the midterm and final may vary. Best 9 assignments count towards final grade.

<div id="cs136">CS136: Might have been the 1st time I actually enjoyed a CS course. If you can, take it with Dave Tompkins. He’s phenomenal (should’ve said that in his evaluation LOL). I didn’t have him 1st semester and I realized what I had missed out on. I can honestly say I didn’t find myself dozing off during a single one of his lectures. 
If you already knew some programming language/s beforehand, prepare to have a blast with this course. I had programmed in Java before, so picking up C wasn’t too bad. The 1st 6-7 assignments were surprisingly easy. You’ll sail right through. Nothing too intensive. You can probably finish in 24 hours if you’re pressed for time, 2 days max. The last couple of assignments might be challenging, since that’s when we delved into the harder content. All in all, pretty riveting course. 
Course structure: 10-11 assignments (worth 20%), 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Weightage of the midterm and final may vary. ALL assignments count towards final grade.
